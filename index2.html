                Original CoSA and After Effects CC 2019 Splash Screen

                After Effects was developed in 1993 and since then has been acquired a hand full of times. The original
                developers, Company of Science and Art (CoSA), created two versions with a few functions that allowed
                you to composite layers and transform various properties of a layer. Fact of the Article: The first
                version was actually only available on the Macintosh computer, built by Apple.

                Acquired in 1994 by Aldus, just one year after launching the program, the program gained amazing new
                features like multi-machine rendering and motion blur. But, before the year of 1994 came to a close,
                Adobe came in and acquired the technology, and is still the owner of After Effects today.

                Since the conception of After Effects, Adobe has released 50 different versions of its industry leading
                software, each time gaining new functionality. Some versions are bigger than others, but they all
                showcase that Adobe has created an extraordinary piece of software.

                In fact, in 2019, the program won an Academy Award for scientific and technical achievement; a testament
                to how well integrated and powerful After Effects is.
